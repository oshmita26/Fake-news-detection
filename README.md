# Fake-news-detection
A type of yellow journalism, fake news encapsulates pieces of news that may be hoaxes and is generally spread through social media and other online media. This project is based upon a classification problem of classifying news as fake or real. The PassiveAggressiveClassifier model was used for this purpose. The model achieved an accuracy of 95.11 %. Lastly a confusion matrix was built to point out the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives. This generates the number of Type-I and Type-II errors.
The TfidfVectorizer converts a collection of raw documents into a matrix of TF-IDF features.
Passive Aggressive algorithms are online learning algorithms. Such an algorithm remains passive for a correct classification outcome, and turns aggressive in the event of a miscalculation, updating and adjusting. Unlike most other algorithms, it does not converge. Its purpose is to make updates that correct the loss, causing very little change in the norm of the weight vector.
